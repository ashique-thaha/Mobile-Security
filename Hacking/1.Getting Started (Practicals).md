Basics:

=>To get `adb` shell
```
adb shell
```

=> use su command to switch users only works if you are root 
=> The `directory` that all the apps are installed on by defaults `/data/data`
=> non-root users cannot access other user files, while roots can.

=> This will prevent unauthorised access of one app's data by another, called `sandboxing`.
=> But there is a method for `inter process communication` called `intents`, this can carry messages across the boundaries with something called `binders`.


=> The sdcard directory: `/sdcard`
=>  unlike the permission models that we saw above the sdcard directory is able to access the data of any application, this is because the application request permission for read or write external storage, which will result in group permission for sdcard directory allowed for the applications that request the permission.
