### Improper Credential Usage

It is a vulnerability that allows misuse of credentials including the hardcoding of credentials, plain text storage of credentials, or failure to validate the credentials properly. This can lead to a security breach, loss of user privacy, and unauthorized access to your sensitive data and systems.

### Inadequate Supply Chain Security

If the components used to build a mobile app aren’t properly checked for security flaws, it opens the door for attackers to inject malicious code into it.

### Insecure Authentication/Authorisation

Without precautions that verify who is using an application or restrict their access to certain data, it makes it easier for someone unauthorised to sneak in.

### Insufficient Input/Output Validation

Applications must double-check user input before processing. Failing to validate user input gives attackers the ability to slip in code meant to harm other users or manipulate data.

### Insecure Communication

Apps that transfer sensitive information over unencrypted channels or use weak encryptions are waiting for their messages to be intercepted by anyone along their route. Normally, an adversary listening on the communication channel can intercept and change data delivered in plaintext or using an obsolete encryption scheme as it travels via the internet and the carrier network of the mobile device. Their intentions might vary and include stealing a person’s identity, espionage, unauthorised access to sensitive information, etc.

### Inadequate Privacy Controls

This potential risk arises when developers fail to implement strong systems to protect user data privacy, leading to a variety of privacy breaches. 

### Insufficient Binary Protections

Since software binaries are usually available from app stores or duplicated from mobile devices, binary attacks are easy to set up. The binaries might include important information, such as private API keys or encoded cryptographic secrets, which an attacker could exploit.

Reconfiguring the payment IDs in an application, repacking it, and distributing it through app stores is a classic form of attack. The attacker then obtains money instead from the legitimate developer when users download this unauthorised copy from the app store.

### Security Misconfiguration

It refers to wrongly set security configurations, permissions, and controls, which are vulnerable and susceptible to unauthorised access. Attackers who could take advantage of security flaws are able to utilise sensitive data to perform malicious actions. 

### Insecure Data Storage

Insecure data storage on a mobile application opens its doors to incidents ranging from direct data extraction to sensitive data leakage. The main reason for this vulnerability is the storage of privileged data in plain text format in insecure file locations. 

### Insufficient Cryptography

An attacker can use such vulnerabilities to bypass encryption, execute cryptographic attacks, modify data, or get unauthorised access to sensitive data. It exposes security flaws that may compromise the efficiency of cryptographic security measures and compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the data within. It includes the use of insecure encryption algorithms or insufficient key lengths, poor key management practices, improper encryption key handling, insecure random number generation, flawed cryptographic protocol implementation, or weaknesses in cryptographic libraries.
