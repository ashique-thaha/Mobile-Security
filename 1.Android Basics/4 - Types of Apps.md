#### Pure Native Apps
- Written on objective C or Swift on iOS and java or KOTLIN on android. 
- These apps are written to use the native UI toolkit. 
- They don't usually make use of the web-view. But some might use web-view for authentication. 
- This includes apps like games and some simple ones which do not need to go out for web services. 
- This is the least common type. 
- it takes more effort to build and test.


#### Hybrid Apps
- A combination of Native UI and web-view. 
- Most common type of app
- Easy to build and test

#### Web Wrappers
- As the name itself the app opens up to a mobile specific web application in a web view.
- This allows codes to be  shared b/w existing web apps and mobile apps in development.
- Every common web vulnerabilities effectively applies here.
