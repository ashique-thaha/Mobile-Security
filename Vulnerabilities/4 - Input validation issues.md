`Sql injection:`
- Look for sql queries in source code if visible, then try usual trial and error method based on the query

`URL tampering:`
- here in this specific scenario i am attempting to access local file using `file://`  uri
- here i am giving a sample exploitation: `file:///data/data/jakhar.aseem.diva/uinfo9043715121375703512tmp`
